# django_tableaux
### Django tables with Advanced User Xperience
This project builds upon two well-established django apps: [django_tables2](https://github.com/jieter/django-tables2) and [django_filter](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter) and enhances their functionality through a sprinkling of [htmx](https://htmx.org) magic. It provides a single class-based view in which you can enable multiple features to deliver a customised user experience that embodies the best practice for interactive tables.
### Enhancements
- User-defined displayable columns
- Responsive: definable layouts for mobile, tablet and desktop
- Bulk actions on selected rows
- Infinite scroll
- Infinite Load more data
- Position filters in a toolbar, in a modal or embed them withing the table header
- Inline editing of fields
- Easy integration with generic views for CRUD operations

The project is still in beta but is fully usable.
